# TE3003B: Integration of Robotics and Intelligent Systems 🤖🌐

This repository contains all the necessary materials for the "TE3003B: Integration of Robotics and Intelligent Systems" course 📚.  
Developed by Manchester Robotics Ltd. (MCR2), the course will guide students through a series of exercises that lead to a final challenge in autonomous systems, with a focus on localization, navigation, and intelligent path-planning using Kalman Filters for 2D map-based localization.

## Requirements
- **Ubuntu 22.04** with **ROS2 Humble** 🐧
- Basic knowledge of robotics (recommended) 🤖
- Access to a **Puzzlebot Jetson/Lidar Edition** 🚗

The repository will be updated with new content and exercises that build towards the final project.
